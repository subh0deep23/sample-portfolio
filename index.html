                        operational standards.Beyond daily tasks, I took ownership of my team's motivation, addressing
                        grievances, reducing

                        while maintaining zero stock variance at the hubs. My goal was always to ensure that operations
                        ran smoothly, customers were satisfied, and company objectives were consistently met.
